Matlab code for computing the co-spectra of wave perturbations (see [my thesis (Pages 54-56)](/files/thesis.pdf))
* [space_time_Hayashi.m](./space_time_Hayashi.m): subroutine to compute the co-spectra using the method described in [Hayashi (1971)](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jmsj1965/49/2/49_2_125/_article)
* [space_time_fft2.m](./space_time_fft2.m): subroutine to compute the co-spectra using matlab's fft2
* [test_space_time.m](./test_space_time.m): sample script to run the space-time co-spectra code with idealized wave perturbations
